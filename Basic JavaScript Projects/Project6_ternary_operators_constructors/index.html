    <!-- A ternary operator operates on three values. It can be used to assign a value to a variable 
    based on a condition. This is also referred to as a conditional operator in that it assigns a value to a variable based on a condition.
    In this code, if your height is less than 52 it will say that you're too short to 
    ride, otherwise it tell you that your tall enough.-->
